Event sourcing mechanism:
- add saving snapshot on exit
- better event saving - ensure that save was executed correctly before dispatching action

Redux store:
- use Immutable.js
- add action validation middleware (probably not needed)
- handle todos removing
- handle getting data

Other:
- make constants for file names
