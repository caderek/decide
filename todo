Event sourcing mechanism:
- add saving snapshot on exit

Redux store:
- use Immutable.js
- add action validation middleware (probably not needed)
- object instead of switch in main reducer and select function
- better handling of changes authorization (something instead of returning unchanged state when unauthorized)

Other:
- make constants for file names
